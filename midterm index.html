		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts was founded as the <strong>Freshman Year Program</strong> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_School">The New School</a> in 1972 as a pre-college program for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school">high school</a> graduates. Three years later, in 1975, the program was expanded to a full undergraduate program and renamed <strong>The Seminar College</strong>. In 1985, following a generous donation by a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropist">philanthropist</a> and educational visionary <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Lang">Eugene Lang</a> and his wife Theresa, the school was renamed Eugene Lang College. The college currently has an enrollment of over 1,345 students.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Lang_College_of_Liberal_Arts#cite_note-6">[6]</a></p>
		<p>In 2005, the phrase "The New School" was inserted into the name of each division of <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_School">The New School</a> as part of a unification strategy initiated by the University's President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kerrey">Bob Kerrey</a>;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Lang_College_of_Liberal_Arts#cite_note-7">[7]</a> thus, Eugene Lang College was renamed <strong>Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts</strong>. In 2015, The New School rebranded again by renaming the schools to better clarify the relationship between the university and its schools. Eugene Lang College's formal title is <strong>The New School's Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts</strong>.</p>
